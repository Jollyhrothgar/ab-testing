    "  - Metrics that shouldn't change across your experiment and control. Sanity check that the experiment is run properly.\n",

    "    - Same number across the two?\n",
    "    - Same distribution? Comparable numbers of users across countries? Comparable numbers of users across languages?\n",
    "- Evaluation\n",
    "  - __High-level business metrics__ (how much revenue you make, what your market share is, how many users you have).\n",
    "  - Then __more detailed metrics__ that focus on the user experience with the product (e.g. how long users stay on the page)\n",
    "  - E.g. Evaluation of why users aren't finishing a video series for a class\n",
    "    - To understand why, we need to dig into the user experience, e.g. the videos could be taking too long to load and we should look at latency\n",
    "  - It's also possible that the business metrics may not work out in the context of an experiment. You may not have the information you need or the time that you're running the experiment may be too short to measure the effect.\n"
